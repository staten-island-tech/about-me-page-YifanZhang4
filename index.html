    <h1>About Me: Yifan Zhang</h1>
    <h2>UHHH School, I guess</h2>
    <p>Hello, this is an about me page. This page is being made for period 7 of Mr. Whalen's AP Computer Science class. The person who is making this page is a sophmore in Staten Island Technical High  School at the time of writing. Here are some of the classes I am being forced to take and why I would rather be anywhere else:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>C.A.D.: I have it first period and nearly fell asleep.</li>
        <li>Algebra 2: Math is my greatest enemy in life.</li>
        <li>AP World History: I didn't pay attention last year and I will now pay for my sins.</li>
        <li>Physics: It's just more math. >:(</li>
        <li>Russian: I sit in the back of the classroom. I am short. I am also blind. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some more classes, but I won't complain about these ones(this time they're numbered, in order of when I have them):</p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Lunch: !!! I don't actually eat lunch, I just like the period because it's a free period. I have lunch period 5, th best period to have lunch.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
