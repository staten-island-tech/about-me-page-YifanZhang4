    <h1>About Me: Yifan Zhang</h1>
    <h2>UHHH School, I guess</h2>
    <p>Hello, this is an about me page. This page is being made for period 7 of Mr. Whalen's AP Computer Science class. I am a sophmore in Staten Island Technical High School at the time of writing. I really have no ideas what to write else to write here. Here are some of the classes I am being forced to take and why I would rather be anywhere else:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>C.A.D.: I have it first period and nearly fell asleep.</li>
        <li>Algebra 2: Math is my greatest enemy in life.</li>
        <li>AP World History: I didn't pay attention last year and I will now pay for my sins.</li>
        <li>Physics: It's just more math and honestly, I'm not here for it.</li>
        <li>Russian: I sit in the back of the classroom. I am short. I am also blind. Last but not least, I'm bad at Russian.</li>
        <li>Badminton: Actually, nothing much agaisnt the sport badminton, I just doing like pysical education in any form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some more classes, but I won't complain about these ones(this time they're numbered, in order of when I have them):</p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Lunch: !!! I don't actually eat lunch, I just like the period because it's a free period. I have lunch period 5, the best lunch period, I take no criticism.</li>
        <li>AP Computer Science Principles: This is the class I'm making this project for. I would be an absolute fool, a buffon, a clown of the highest degree to complain about it. </li>
        <li>English: I like this subject because it's really easy to not take it seriously and still do sort of good. :)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I'm being required to have 1(one) external link and 1(one) "school appropriate" meme.</p>
